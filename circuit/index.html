                                The Le Mans circuit's origins can be traced back to 1921 when a 10.71-mile course from
                                Pontlieue to Mulsanne and Arnage was first used. Racing had been held in the Le Mans area
                                since 1906, but it was in 1923 that the iconic 24 Heures Du Mans race took place.
                                The inaugural race, organized in response to a generous offer from Emille Coquille, marked
                                the beginning of an annual institution. In 1926, a disagreement with landowners led to the
                                relocation of the main grandstand, and the circuit underwent asphalt upgrades.

                                In 1929, the first major alteration to the circuit layout occurred with the introduction of
                                a new link road bypassing the Pontlieue suburbs. However, by 1932, this section was deemed unsafe,
                                leading to the construction of the Dunlop Curve and the famous Esses as a new link road.
                                World War 2 interrupted proceedings, with the circuit repurposed for German occupation. After the war,
                                extensive rebuilding was required to restore the facilities.

                                The tragic events of 1955, marked by a fatal crash involving Pierre Levegh's Mercedes, prompted immediate
                                changes for the 1956 race. Safety improvements included moving pits further back, widening the pit straight,
                                and enhancing spectator enclosures. In 1965, the construction of the Bugatti Circuit provided an alternative route.
                                The Ford Chicane was introduced in 1968, and further modifications occurred in 1971-72, replacing sections
                                of public road with the wider stretch featuring the Porsche Curves. Subsequent decades brought various adjustments,
                                including the insertion of chicanes in 1987, 1990, and 1991 to manage increasing speeds. Despite the revisions,
                                Le Mans maintained its allure for participants and spectators alike.

                                The late 1960s and early 1970s marked a period of further transformation for the Le Mans circuit. In 1968,
                                the iconic Ford Chicane was introduced at the final corner, adding a new dynamic to the track. The years that
                                followed saw ongoing adjustments, and during 1971-72, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) began eliminating
                                sections of public road, replacing the narrow stretch after Arnage with a wider section that incorporated the
                                Porsche Curves. These changes aimed to enhance safety and maintain the competitiveness of the races.

                                The early to mid-1970s brought about a series of refinements and safety measures to the Le Mans circuit.

                                public road and the introduction of a new, wider stretch featuring the Porsche Curves. The period from 1972 to 1978

                                During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, the Le Mans circuit underwent additional changes. In 1979,
                                Tertre Rouge was tightened to accommodate a new ring road around the town, contributing to improved traffic flow.
                                Then, in 1986, Mulsanne Corner saw slight reconfiguration to navigate a newly constructed roundabout efficiently.
                                These modifications reflected a commitment to both safety and the integration of the circuit into the evolving
                                infrastructure of the surrounding area.

                                These modifications addressed the evolving nature of endurance racing and emphasized the importance of balancing

                                split into three shorter blasts with the introduction of chicanes. These alterations responded to the increasing
                                top speeds, exceeding 250mph, and aimed to enhance driver safety. The bumpy chicanes, though initially met with mixed
