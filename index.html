        <h1>The Early Years</h1>

                <p>
                    In 1906, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Club_de_l%27Ouest">Automobile Club de l'Ouest</a>
                    orchestrated the inaugural automobile race, marking the genesis of Le Mans' association with high-speed competitions.
                    This pioneering event attracted a modest yet fervent group of participants eager to showcase the endurance and speed
                    of their early automobiles. Little did they know that this event would lay the foundation for one of the most iconic
                    races in the world, the legendary <em>24 Hours of Le Mans</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 24 Hours of Le Mans originated in 1923 as a three-year event, evolving into an annual race. Initially, the winner
                    was determined by the car covering the farthest distance over three consecutive <em class="important">24-hour</em> races. French, British, and
                    Italian dominance characterized the early years, with Bugatti, Bentley, and Alfa Romeo leading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resuming in 1949, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II">post-World War II era</a> saw increased manufacturer interest, forming the World Sportscar
                    Championship in 1953. However, tragedy struck in 1955 with the Le Mans disaster, prompting safety measures.
                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster">1955 Le Mans disaster</a> occurred during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, where tragedy struck in a catastrophic manner.
                    Pierre Levegh's car crashed into a crowd of spectators, resulting in the deaths of more than 80 people. The incident
                    prompted shockwaves throughout the motorsport world and led to a profound reevaluation of safety measures not only at
                    the Le Mans circuit but also across the entire racing community.

        <h1>Golden Age of Endurance Racing</h1>
        <div class="content">

                <p>
                    The 1970s ushered in a spectacular era in the history of Le Mans, often regarded as the Golden Age of Endurance Racing.
                    During this period, the race saw a remarkable convergence of extreme speeds, groundbreaking automotive designs, and a
                    diverse array of manufacturers vying for supremacy on the iconic <a>Circuit de la Sarthe</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_917">Porsche 917</a> emerged as one of
                    the most dominant forces, etching its name in the annals of motorsports history with unprecedented victories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    French manufacturers, namely Matra-Simca and Renault, also left an indelible mark on the race, showcasing their
                    engineering prowess and national pride. Privateer constructors, such as Mirage and Rondeau, added an extra layer of
                    excitement, proving that innovation and determination could stand toe-to-toe with the established giants in endurance
                    racing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 1980s witnessed a continuation of Porsche's dominance, particularly with the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_C">Group C cars</a>. These
                    machines <em>pushed the boundaries of speed and technology</em>, setting records that would stand for years. Meanwhile,
                    formidable challengers in the form of Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz brought a new level of competition to the track, creating
                    memorable battles for supremacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the decade progressed, Japanese manufacturers made their presence felt, introducing a new dimension to the
                    competition. The era saw the rise of iconic cars like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_787B">Mazda 787B</a>, which secured a historic victory in 1991, making
                    Mazda the first and only Japanese manufacturer to win the overall title at Le Mans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The demise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Sportscar_Championship">World Sportscar Championship</a> in the late 1980s led to a shift in the racing landscape, giving rise to
                    a resurgence of production-based grand tourers. Porsche's ingenious exploitation of a regulatory loophole in 1994 marked
                    a pivotal moment, setting the stage for a new breed of exotic supercars that would challenge established norms and
                    redefine the concept of endurance racing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 1990s also witnessed the expansion of the Le Mans name beyond the borders of Europe, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Le_Mans_Series">American Le Mans Series</a>
                    was established in 1999. This move further globalized the appeal of endurance racing, attracting a diverse array of
                    manufacturers and drivers eager to test their mettle on different continents.

                <p>
                    The 24 Hours of Le Mans has continuously evolved to stay at the forefront of automotive innovation and competition. In
                    2021, the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Mans_Hypercar">Hypercar class</a> marked a significant milestone. This class allowed the participation of
                    both Le Mans Hypercars and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMDh">LMDh</a> cars, creating a platform for manufacturers to showcase
                    cutting-edge technology and design. The 2021 race, however, faced a unique challenge as it was postponed due to the
                    global circumstances, leading to non-hybrid LMP1 cars participating as "<em>grandfathered</em>" entries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the notable competitors in the Hypercar class were Toyota, Glickenhaus, and Alpine, each bringing their
                    technological prowess and racing pedigree to the iconic circuit. The new Hypercar regulations provided teams with
                    greater design freedom, shaping the future of Le Mans racing and setting the stage for a new era of competition.

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, the future of Le Mans promises even more excitement and innovation. The LMP2 regulations have been
                    extended to 2024, ensuring the continued presence of these highly competitive prototypes on the track. Furthermore, a
                    groundbreaking development is on the horizon with the introduction of new-generation LMP2 cars serving as the chassis
                    for LMDh prototypes in 2025. This move aims to bridge the gap between the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_racing_(motorsport)">endurance racing</a> and the prestigious
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Daytona">Daytona 24 Hours</a>, fostering a more global and interconnected racing community.

                <p>
                    One of the most intriguing prospects for Le Mans is the anticipated entry of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle">hydrogen-powered</a> prototypes in 2025, with
                    the ambitious goal of vying for overall victory. This represents a bold step toward sustainable and <em class="important">environmentally

                    and reduce the ecological impact of motorsports.
